          <div class="contentTextBox">
            <h4>The Trails</h4>
            <p>Take a stroll around our 0.4 mile raised boardwalk. Stay clean and dry while getting an up-close view of the swamp. The boardwalk is wheelchair accessible. 
            </p>
  
            <p>The boardwalk takes you under the canopy of the towering bald cypress forest. You will get to experience all the unique features of these trees. See the colorful peeling bark, and the knobby “knees” that protrude from the water. Visit the BLOG PAGE to learn more about these trees.
            </p>
  
            <p>When you are finished with the boardwalk loop, consider taking the short connecting path to the meadow. Need a TRAIL MAP? 
            </p>
  
            <h4>The Meadow</h4>
            <p>This trail forms a 0.3 mile loop. In the center, you will find a field of native grasses and wildflowers. The meadow lowers park upkeep, increases water infiltration, and stores carbon. It also creates a habitat for pollinators, songbirds, and other wildlife. This link to <i>The Southern Maryland Chronicle</i> tells you how this ecosystem is maintained by CONTROLLED BURNS. 
            </p>
  
            <p>The edge of the meadow is lined with hundreds of trees. Native and non-invasive species have been planted all along the path. Each tree is labeled with its own sign full of fun facts.     
            </p>
  
            <h4>The Aviary</h4>
            <p>The aviary is an outdoor structure which houses three disabled birds. 
            </p>
  
            <p>On the far left is a Barred Owl. The owl arrived in 2018. It had been struck by a car, which damaged its vison.
            </p>
  
            <p>An Eastern Screech Owl lives in the middle stall. The bird came here in 2014 after an injury made it unable to fly well.
            </p>
  
            <p>On the far right, lives a Red-Tailed Hawk. It was injured as a fledgling in 2002. The hawk had its left wing amputated. 
            </p>
  
            <p>These lucky birds are now cared for by the park staff. Each bird gets a precious second chance at life. 
            </p>
  
  
            <h4>The Nature Center</h4>
  
            <p>The nature center is currently closed due to fire damage.
