              <div class="about3Right">
                <p>The current 100 acre preserve began in 1957. A lot happened before then.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>Late 1600s- Robert Brooke gave Battle Creek its name as a tribute to his late wife. Battle was the name of her hometown.
                  </li>

                  <li>1900s- Many bald cypress trees were cut down for lumber.  
                  </li>

                  <li>1900s- The Grays family used the swamp to collect ice in the winter. They stored it and made ice cream in the summer. They also provided  housing in exchange for farming labor. You can see a tenant house commissioned by Lawrence Gray in the image to the left.
                  </li>

                  <li>1940s and 1950s- Two scientists, Romeo Mansueti and Flippo Gravatt noted the rarity of the swamp’s ecosystem. 
                  </li>

                  <li>1957- The Nature Conservancy purchased the land.
                  </li>

                  <li>1965- It was designated a National Natural Landmark.
                  </li>

                  <li>1977- Boardwalk construction began. The sanctuary was leased to Calvert County, MD and began operation as a county park.
                  </li>
